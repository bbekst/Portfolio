							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p class="major" style="font-size: 20px;">I am Bibek Satyal, a graduate student studying data analytics at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. My expertise lies in complex data analysis, data visualization, predictive modeling, and process automation. I have a keen interest for machine learning and I am actively seeking opportunities to broaden my knowledge and gain valuable experience in this domain.<br>
								<br>
								With over five years of experience, my focus has primarily been on data analysis and process automation. In addition to my technical and analytical skills, I have also developed leadership, customer service, project management, and teamwork skills. I am actively seeking an opportunity to collaborate with a passionate team dealing with extensive datasets, where I can leverage my technical and analytical skills to develop diverse machine learning models.</p>

						<h2>Python | Linear Regression | Abalone Age Prediction</h2>
						<p>In this study, we employed two linear regression methods—Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)—to predict the age of abalones based on physical measurements. OLS was implemented from scratch using only NumPy and Pandas, while SGDRegressor utilized Scikit-Learn's built-in libraries. Model performances were evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination. Visualization of actual vs predicted and residual plots was accomplished using the seaborn library. The results indicate a slight superiority of the OLS method over the SGD Regressor.</p>

							<h2>Python | MLP Classification | Wine Quality</h2>
							<p>We employed a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to classify wine quality, implementing it in Python. During model training and testing, we experimented with three parameter combinations, adjusting the learning rate, hidden layers, and activation function. Model evaluation included diverse metrics—classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, harmonic mean, and logarithmic loss—calculated using Scikit-Learn. ROC curves, visualized with matplotlib, showcased nuanced performance variations across parameter combinations, yielding area under the curve values ranging from 85% to 87% in the training dataset and 81% to 85% in the test dataset.</p>

						<h2>Python | Regular Vs Convolutional Neural Network | Optical Depth Measurement (In-progress)</h2>
						<p>We are employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using tensorflow to analyze the simulated images of the early universe and compare the results with those obtained from a regular neural network that relies on statistical measurements of those simulations to measure the optical depth to the cosmic microwave background. Our expectation is that the results obtained from the CNN-based analysis of the images will produce better results compared to the results obtained from the regular neural network that uses statistical measurements.</p>

							<h2>Python | Naïve Bayes Classifier | Oranges Vs Grapefruits</h2>
							<p>The objective of this project was to employ a Naïve Bayes Classifier (NBC) to classify oranges and grapefruits, relying on five key features: diameter, weight, and three distinct colors. The study leveraged the Scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy libraries to analyze a comprehensive dataset comprising 10,000 data instances. Impressively, the model demonstrated its proficiency by achieving a remarkable 92% accuracy on both the train and test datasets.</p>

						<h2>Python | Soccer Players' Performances | Club Vs International Games</h2>
						<p>In this study, we compared the performances of twelve players in both club and international soccer games. By analyzing datasets containing information on appearances and goals over a three-year period, the findings did not indicate a significant difference in players' performances between club and international games.</p>

						<h2>R | Geographic Distribution of Airbnb Pricing</h2>
						<p>The purpose of this analysis was to investigate the potential relationship between geographical distribution and Airbnb pricing in Las Vegas. Statistical techniques including correlation and regression were employed. The main objective was to determine if a correlation existed between Airbnb prices and the distance from two key locations: the Las Vegas Strip and Downtown. While the initial raw data showed a moderate negative correlation between price and distance, the analysis results indicated a weak correlation between the distance from these locations and the prices of Airbnb listings.</p>
